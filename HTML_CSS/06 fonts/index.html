                                    React Native is an open source framework for building Android

                                    capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your 
                                    platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior 
                                    of your UI using React components: <span class="italics"> bundles of reusable, nestable

                                    React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for 
                                    building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of 
                                    React Native, it helps to understand React itself. 
                                    This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                                    in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
                                    names and a cafe to work in.
                                </p>

                                    <span class="fat">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                                     write elements inside JavaScript like so:  
                                     <span class="color">&ltText&gt Hello, I am your cat! &ltText&gt</span>
                                </p>
                                <p class="text_title">
                                    The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can 
                                    refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can 
                                    use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="color">name</span> for the cat,
                                    name, and embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="color">&ltText&gt</span>
                                </p>
                                <p class="text_title">
                                    <span class="fat">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.

                                    <span class="fat">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to 
                                    configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs 
                                    personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that 
                                    changes over time or that comes from user interaction. 
                                    State gives your components memory!

                                    TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter 
                                    text. It has an <span class="italics">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be 
                                    called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing 
                                    prop that takes a function to be called when the text is 
                                    submitted.

                                    For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating 
                                    their words into a different language. In this new language, 
                                    every single word is written the same way: üçï. 
                                    So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
